- 👋 Hi, I’m @jeffreyongley
- 👀 I’m interested in developing my skills and applying the theory obtained through my education to real world applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently working with C++, Python, and Javascript. My educational background is heavily in C++ due to CSUSB's curriculum. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that can help me learn how to collaborate on large projects on Github.
