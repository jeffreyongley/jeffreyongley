- 👋 Hi, I’m @jeffreyongley
- 👀 I’m interested in developing my skills and applying the theory obtained through my education to real world applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, Python and Javascript. C++ is what my college CSUSB builds its curriculum on. I personally am more interested in and see more applications for Python and Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that can help me learn how to collaborate on large projects on Github.
