- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jeffreyongley, Im a software engineer with 3 years of industry experience.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m starting to finally use github for my personal work after using GitLab for years for work.
- ðŸŒ± Professionally I have worked with PHP, Javascript, and a bit of Python.
- ðŸŒ± I want to get better at my Javascript skills so I plan to use Github to create a few simple apps with React.
